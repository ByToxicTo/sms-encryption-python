## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Warning

**DO NOT use this substitution cipher for any real security purposes!**

The character mappings in this code (e.g., 'a' ‚Üí '@', 'e' ‚Üí '3') are **extremely weak** and obvious. This implementation is purely for **educational purposes** to demonstrate basic Python concepts.

### üîí For Real Encryption:
- Use established cryptographic libraries like `cryptography`
- Implement proven algorithms like AES-GCM
- Never roll your own crypto for production systems
- Always use properly generated random keys

**This example is easily breakable and provides no real security.**
